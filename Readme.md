#AUTO INSURANCE COMPANY

##DESCRIPTION:
For an Auto Insurance Company we predict the customer life-time value(CLV), CLV is the total revenue the client will derive from the entire relationship with a customer. Our aim is also to find the customer base which would be more beneficial. 

##APPROACH:
STEP 1: Data exploration and analysis:
        We find important charaterstics and patterns in our data set by making the correlation matrix and other graphs to find some
        hypothesis about what out data set is likely to support
        
 STEP 2:FEATURE ENGINEERING
        We apply feature engineering to prepare a proper input dataset, compatible with machine learning algorithm so as to improve the 
        performance of machine learning models
        In our project we have applied label encoding , one hot encoding, log transform, Scaling
        
 STEP 3:ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES
        We have applied different models like linear regression, decision tree regression, XGBoost and random forest to predict the CLV and         we found that the best result (least RMSE) came from the random forest model.
        
 STEP 4: CONCLUSION
